This is a banking system project that can be used for day to day business of a bank. A banking system is a group or network of institutions that provide financial services for us. These institutions are responsible for operating a payment system, providing loans, taking deposits, and helping with investments. In this project we have tried to implement a few aspects of the banking system using spring boot framework. 
Some of The features include:
User authentication - Creating account (signup), login 
Add a new bank account within the application 
Transaction functions such as

 Deposit - Add money to a particular account
 Transfer - Send money to a person
 Withdrawal - Remove money from an account
